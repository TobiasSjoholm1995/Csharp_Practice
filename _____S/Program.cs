    // Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), states that a module 
    // should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality 
    // provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by it.

    // A software entity should have only one reason to change.

    // Big grey zone for interpretation

    // Bad:  Big software entities
    // Good: Thin software entities that do only 1 thing and does it well.
